Problem Definition:
Design and develop a simple Todo application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. The application should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add Task**: Users should be able to add new tasks to their Todo list. This involves providing an input field where users can type their task and a button to submit the task.

2. **Delete Task**: Users should be able to delete tasks from the Todo list. Each task in the list should have a delete button associated with it, allowing users to remove tasks they no longer need.

3. **Checkbox for Task Completion**: Each task in the Todo list should have a checkbox indicating whether the task has been completed or not. Users should be able to mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox.

4. **Task Display**: The application should display the list of tasks added by the user. Tasks should be displayed with their associated checkbox and delete button.

5. **Immediate Deletion**: Tasks should be immediately removed from the list when the user clicks on the delete button. There should be no additional confirmation required for deletion.

6. **User Interface**: The application should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface, providing clear visual cues for adding, deleting, and completing tasks. It should follow the principles of Material Design to ensure consistency and usability across different devices.

7. **Persistence (Optional)**: Optionally, the application can provide persistence functionality, allowing users to save their Todo list even after closing the application. This can be achieved by storing the tasks locally on the device or using cloud-based storage solutions.

Overall, the Todo application should offer a seamless user experience for managing tasks efficiently, helping users stay organized and productive in their daily activities.
